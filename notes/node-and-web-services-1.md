# Node.js and Web Services - 1

## Overview

- By this point you have seen how we can access JSON web services from the web browser using JavaScript:
  - [Web Apps Part 10 - Web Services](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-Master/blob/master/notes/web-apps-10.md)
  - [Homework: GIF Finder](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-gif-finder.md)
  - [Web Service App - Examples & Starters](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-Master/blob/master/notes/web-service-app-starters.md)
- We can also download web pages and services from the **command line** using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - below we will work through a few examples, giving us more of a chance to work with both web services and Node.js
- We will also see how we can easily create symbolic links with node and run these scripts as command line tools

## I. Install Node.js and npm (if you need to) 

- **Node.js** is a command-line JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, **npm**, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.
  - https://nodejs.org/en/
- **npm** is the package (i.e. "library") manager for JavaScript
  - https://www.npmjs.com
  - There are user-contributed packages for nearly *everything* that a JavaScript dev might want to do - where are links to some packages that we are using in this class (let's take a peek at these now):
    - https://www.npmjs.com/package/request
    - https://www.npmjs.com/package/cowsay
    - https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack
    - https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-cli
    
  
To see if you already have node and npm installed on your computer, type the following in the console:

  ```js
  node -v
  npm -v
  ```
  
### A) How to install Node.js 
 
 - You can head to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and grab an installer - instructions are here:
 
 https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node
 
 
### B) Test that node and npm are installed
 
 - When **Node.js** is installed, it also installs **npm** (*Node Package Manager*). Head to the command prompt (On a Mac use the *Terminal* application, on PC use *GitBash* or *Powershell* etc) to verify that `npm` is installed by typing:
 
   ```js
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```
 
 - After that, you can run the updater on npm by typing (Mac users will need `sudo` at the beginning of this command):
 
   ```js
   npm install npm@latest -g
   ```
 
 - ***At this point you should be ready to go!***

## II. "Hello Node"
 
 Let's write a "Hello world" command-line script to be sure everything works:
 - create a folder named **hello**
 - inside of this folder create a new file named **index.js**
 - add one line of code to this file:

    ```js
    console.log("Hello node!");
    ```
  
 - in the console (or Terminal on Mac), change directory to the **hello** folder
 - type `node index.js` - you should now see the `"Hello node!"` message printed to the console

## III. Downloading and displaying a simple "text" web service

- We are going to keep this as bare-bones as possible (not even using `npm`), so we will just download a joke from a "random geek joke" web service. The web service will return the joke data in plain text format - here are the docs:
  - https://github.com/sameerkumar18/geek-joke-api
- and here is the URL to the service:
  - https://geek-jokes.sameerkumar.website/api

If you test the above link in a browser, you will see a random plain-text joke such as `"E-mail returned to sender... insufficient voltage."`


### A. Get started:
  - create a folder named **joke**
  - inside of the **joke** folder, create a file named **index.js**
  
### B. Add the following to **index.js**:

```js
// #1 - import the request module, which is used to download data over http
const request = require('request');

// #2 - set our URL
let url = 'https://geek-jokes.sameerkumar.website/api';

// #3 - make the request
// the second parameter below is a callback function (an ES6 arrow function in this case)
// which is called when the data is downloaded
request(url, (err, response, body) => {
    // if there's no error, and if the server's status code is 200 (i.e. "Ok")
    if(!err && response.statusCode == 200){
    	// log out the plain-text joke - no parsing required!
        console.log(body);
    }
});
```
  
### C. Open your console, and change directory to the **joke** folder. Run the script by typing:

  ```js
  node index.js
  ```

### D. FAILURE!

- You should see a series of error messages that begin with **`Error: Cannot find module 'request'`** 
- This is happening because you never downloaded the files that node needs to actually import the **request** module code.

### E. Download the **request** module files by typing this: 

(Make sure that you are still in the **joke** folder)
  
  ```js
  npm install request
  ```

- Downloading of files now should begin. Once downloading has completed, you will see a few warnings about a file named **package.json** missing - we will address this in the next chapter.
- You should now see a folder named **node_modules** - open it up and you will that that there are approximately 50 sub-folders, including one named **request**. These additional folders are all of the modules that the **request module** is dependent on.
- You will see one more file - **package-lock.json**  - this file keeps track of all of the project modules and dependencies - you won't need to worry about for our examples - but if you wish you can read about it here: https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package-lock.json

### F. Try to run the app again by typing:

  ```js
  node index.js
  ```

**SUCCESS! - You should see a joke in the console - something like:**

  ```
  "The First rule of Chuck Norris is: you do not talk about Chuck Norris."
  ```

## IV. Have a cow!

- Have some fun with the **cowsay** package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/cowsay

### IV-B. Instructions

- import the package (add this to the top of **index.js**): `const cowsay = require("cowsay");`
- install the package (type this on the command line): `npm install cowsay`
- use the package by replacing - `console.log(body);` - with:

```js
console.log(cowsay.say({
	text : body,
	e : "oO"
}));
```

**Which gives, when you run this in the console (by typing `node index.js`):**

## V. Next Steps

- There isn't too much more to do with this example right now, as this web service has but one entry point (i.e. it does 1 thing and accepts no additional parameters)
- But once you have finished this series, come back to this example and:
  - use `npm init -y` to create a **package.json** file
  - using what you learn in Chapter II as a guide, make this script an executable command named `get-joke`
