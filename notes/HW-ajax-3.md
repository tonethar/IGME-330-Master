# HW - Ajax-3 - loading and parsing XML files

## Overview

- The video walkthrough for this assignment is here --> 
- We will build on what we did last time by modifying our CSV loading code to instead download and parse an XML ("E**x**tensible **M**arkup **L**anguage") file


<hr>

## I. Start files
- You might want to start by first making a copy of your **ajax-2/** folder from last time, and naming the copy **ajax-3/**
- Go ahead and rename your completed HTML file from last time - from **xhr-get-csv.html** to **xhr-get-xml.html** 
- Below is the plain-text data file **pet-names.xml** that we will use this time
- **pet-names.xml** contains popular dog and cat pet names "marked up"
- go ahead and create the **pet-names.xml** file and put it in your **data/** folder

**data/pet-names.xml**
