- "Bulma is a free, open source framework that provides ready-to-use frontend components that you can easily combine to build responsive web interfaces."
- Bulma is mobile friendly & responsive by default
- Bulma is modern - built with Flexbox - but with much more intuitive syntax
- Bulma doesn't use any JavaScript (unlike Bootstrap) - it's up to the developer to add it. This makes it very easy to integrate with VanillaJS, web components, Vue.js, React etc
