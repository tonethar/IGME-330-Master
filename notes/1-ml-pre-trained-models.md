# Machine Learning with ml5 - pre-trained models

## I. What is Machine Learning

- "A field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed" - [Arthur Samuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Samuel)
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning
- We will be looking at the [ml5]() machine learning API
  - this API "wraps" Tensorflow (which you have probably heard of) and makes model loading and training new models easier
- We will be looking at *supervised learning* in this class - which makes use of *labeled* datasets where we provide the API with training data that consists of an *input* (for example a "vectorized" image or piece of text) and the desired *output* value (ex. a label such as "dog") 
- The trained model is only as "good" as the dataset it's given:
