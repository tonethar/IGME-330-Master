<h1>Web Component - with attributes and <code>connectedCallback()</code></h1>
<p>Here we have a new component, <code>&lt;rit-footer></code> that has <ode>data-year</code> and <ode>data-text</code> attributes</p>
<p>We are also utilizing the <code>connectedCallback()</code> lifecycle method, which is invoked each time the custom element is appended into a document-connected element</p>

<h2>Sub-heading I</h2>
<rit-footer data-year="2019" data-text="Ace Amway"></rit-footer>
<h2>Sub-heading II</h2>
<rit-footer data-year="2020" data-text="Babs Babcock"></rit-footer>
<h2>Sub-heading III</h2>
<rit-footer data-year="2021" data-text="Chris Crinkle"></rit-footer>
<h2>Sub-heading IV</h2>
<rit-footer></rit-footer>
