# Lorenz Attractor

## I. Overview

- What's an *attractor*? Read here for some examples --> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor
- The *Lorenz Attractor* is a *Strange Attractor* --> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor#Strange_attractor - and was created/discovered by Edward Lorenz while he was studying how to simulate convection currents present in weather phenomena.
- [Dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system) such as these as seen throughout nature, and are compelling subjects to explore utilizing interactive media.
- Today we will implement this system in JavaScript/Canvas - and pretty much as a port of Daniel Shiffman's Java/Processing example linked below. (Thanks so much to Daniel for his series of creative coding videos!)
- There are other "Strange Attractors":
