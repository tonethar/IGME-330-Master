# JavaScript Objects & the JavaScript Prototype Chain

- Ever wondered how JavaScript's ES6 class *inheritance* model is implemented?
  - Didn't think so!
  - We're going to cover it anyway - because there are a lot of ways to create object instances besides calling the *constructor* of a class - ex. `let m1 = new Orc()` - and below we are going to explore some of these!
  
## I. JavaScript Object Literals

- "JavaScript is designed on a simple object-based paradigm. An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method." - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects

- Unlike nearly every other programming language, in JavaScript we can create objects without having to first create a *class*
  - this means we can create *object literals* using *object initializer* syntax like this: 

```js
let obj = {
	"property1" : "value1",
	"property2" : "value2"
};
```

- Property *values* can be of any legal JavaScript type: `String`, `Number`, `Array`, `Object`, `Function`, `undefined`, `null`, and so on

```js
let obj2 = {
	"property1" : "stringValue",
	"property2" : 100,	// number
	"property3" : [], 	// array
	"property4" : obj, 	// another object
	"property5" : function(){console.log("hello");} // function
};
```
- Property *keys* can be a `String`, `Number`, or an *identifier* (variable, function name, class name, etc)

```js
let obj3 = {
	"stringProperty" 	: "value3",
	100 			: "value4",
	obj2			: "value5",
};
```

- We can therefore access the property values of our 3 objects like this:

```js
obj.property1; 		
obj2["property1"]; // demos square bracket syntax
obj3[100];
```
- We can *add* properties to our objects like this (probably the #1 source of JavaScript bugs):

```js
obj.property3 = "value3";
```

- We can *delete* properties of our objects like this:

```js
delete obj.property2; // GONE!
```

- we can make it so properties can't be added with `Object.seal()`

```js
Object.seal(obj); // can't add properties
// now try to add a property, it fails quietly in console
```	

- we can make it so properties can't be added, nor can existing properties be modified with `Object.freeze()`

```js
Object.freeze(obj2);  // can't add properties, or modify existing ones
// now try to modify or add a property, it fails quietly in console
```

- we can get more fined-grained control (*enumerable*, *writable*, etc on a *per property* basis) over our properties with [`Object.defineProperty()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty)

- we can also use:
  - JavaScript [setters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set)
  - JavaScript [getters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get)'

### I-A. Questions

1. If we try to *get* a non-existent *property* of an object - ex. `let score = obj.score;` - what happens?

2. If we try to *call* a non-existent *method* of an object - ex. `let score = obj.getScore();` - what happens?


<hr>

## II. JavaScript Object instances created with the ES6 class syntax
 - guess what - the instances that an ES6 class creates are pretty much the same as the object literals above!
 
```js
class Orc{
	constructor(amtGold=1){
		this.hitpoints = 5;
		this.gold = amtGold;
	}
	yell(){
		console.log(`...roar...`);
	}
	
	brag(){
		console.log(`I have ${this.gold} gold!`);
	}
}

class BigOrc extends Orc{
	constructor(amtGold=10){
		super(amtGold);
		this.multiAttack = true;
	}
	yell(){ // override `yell`
		console.log(`ROAR!!`);
	}
}

const m1 = new Orc();
const m2 = new BigOrc(100);
```

- **Run the example below, and check out the `__proto__` (pronounced "dunder proto") property to see how JS "inheritance" works - we'll walk through that in the next section:**

};

let obj2 = {
	"property1" : "stringValue",
	"property2" : 100,	// `number` value
	"property3" : [], 	// `array` value
	"property4" : obj, 	// another `object` as a value
	"property5" : function(){console.log("hello!");} // `function` as a value
};


let obj3 = {
	"stringProperty" 	: "value3", // string key
	100 							: "value4", // number key
	obj2							: "value5", // object reference key
};

obj.property3 = "value3";
delete obj.property2; // GONE!

Object.seal(obj); // can't add properties
// now try to add property, it fails quietly in console

Object.freeze(obj2);  // can't add properties, or modify existing ones
// now try to modify or add a property, it fails quietly in console


class Orc{
	constructor(amtGold=1){
		this.hitpoints = 5;
		this.gold = amtGold;
	}
	
	yell(){
		console.log(`...roar...`);
	}

	brag(){
		console.log(`I have ${this.gold} gold!`);
	}
}

class BigOrc extends Orc{
	constructor(amtGold=10){
		super(amtGold);
		this.multiAttack = true;
	}
	yell(){ // override `yell`
		console.log(`ROAR!!`);
	}
}

const m1 = new Orc(3);
const m2 = new BigOrc();

## III. JavaScript Prototype Chain

### Overview - JavaScript classes are "syntactic sugar"
- *JavaScript classes, introduced in ECMAScript 2015, are primarily syntactical sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance. The class syntax does not introduce a new object-oriented inheritance model to JavaScript.* 
  - MDN Web Docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes

### So how do JavaScript classes work?
- Behind the scenes, the JavaScript compiler uses JavaScript's *prototype-based inheritance* as a way to override or extend object behavior. 
- Below is from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain

**JavaScript objects are dynamic "bags" of properties (referred to as *own* properties). JavaScript objects have a link to a *prototype object*. When trying to access a property of an object, the property will not only be sought on the object but on the *prototype* of the object, the prototype of the prototype, and so on until either a property with a matching name is found or the end of the prototype chain is reached.**

### III-A.`Object.prototype`

The `Object.prototype` property points at the *Object prototype object*. (what?)

What is a prototype object? Here is an excerpt from this MDN page: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/prototype

*A typical object inherits properties (including methods) from Object.prototype, although these properties may be shadowed (a.k.a. overridden).*

*Changes to the Object prototype object are seen by all objects through prototype chaining, unless the properties and methods subject to those changes are overridden further along the prototype chain.  This provides a very powerful although potentially dangerous mechanism to override or extend object behavior.*

<hr>

#### III-A-i. The "default" prototype chain

**Let's see what the default prototype object is on our simple `vehicle` object below. This code:**

**vehicle-object-dot-create-1.html**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8" />
	<title>Vehicle-1 Object.create()</title>
</head>
<body>
<script>
let vehicle = {
  year: 2018,
  numWheels: 4,
  move(){
    console.log("Moving the vehicle now");
  }
};

console.log(vehicle.toString());
debugger;
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Gives us this in the debugger:**

![Screenshot](_images/canvas-sprites-object-create-1.jpg)

<hr>

**\*\*Try this\*\***

- Go ahead and type this into the HTML file above - here we are adding properties one at a time - rather than all at the same time as above
- Take a look in the debugger - what's the difference between `vehicle` AND `objVehicle`

```js
let objVehicle = {};
objVehicle.year = 2019;
objVehicle.numWheels = 6;
objVehicle.move = function() { console.log("move!!"); };
```

<hr>

#### III-A-ii. Discussion

- above we see that the `year`, `numWheels` and `move` properties are on the main part of the object, and that under the `__proto__` property is the *prototype object*, which gives us the implicit built-in in properties (methods in this case) of `Object`. 
- FYI - `__proto__` is pronounced "dunder proto"
- the `year`, `numWheels` and `move` properties of `vehicle` are referred to as "own" properties. You can think of "own" properties as the properties that are explicitly defined on that object,and not on one of its prototypes.
- if we try to access a property or method that does not exist on the main object, the property will be sought on that object's *prototype*. This behavior of walking the prototype objects and seeking properties is called the *prototype chain*. 

Below is from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain

**Each object has a private property which holds a link to another object called its *prototype*. That prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with `null` as its prototype. By definition, `null` has no prototype, and acts as the final link in this prototype chain.**

<hr>

#### III-A-iii. An example of the prototype chain in action
So what do we get when we call `toString()` on `vehicle` like this:

`console.log(vehicle.toString());`

We get: 

`[object Object]`

in the console - which isn't too exciting, but indicates that `vehicle` "inherited" `toString()` from its prototype object.

<hr>

#### III-A-iv. Property shadowing
You can use *property shadowing* to create a form of method overriding. Below we will give `vehicle` its own version of `toString()`, which will "shadow" the default implementation of `toString()` in the prototype object.

**vehicle-object-dot-create-2.html**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8" />
	<title>Vehicle-2 Object.create()</title>
</head>
<body>
<script>
let vehicle = {
  year: 2018,
  numWheels: 4,
  move(){
    console.log("Moving the vehicle now");
  },
  toString(){ // NEW!
  	return "Year: " + this.year + ", numWheels: " + this.numWheels;
  }
};

console.log(vehicle.toString());
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

Which gives: 

`Year: 2018, numWheels: 4` 

in the console, and confirms that vehicle's version of `toString()` shadowed the prototype's version. 

If you check the debugger, you will also see that there is a `toString` property on the top level of the object (as an "own" property).

### III-B. `Object.create()`, Delegation & OLOO - "Objects Linked to Other Objects"

Now let's see how `Object.create()` will allow us to specify an instance's prototype object, rather than relying on the default prototype object.

The `Object.create()` method creates a new object with the specified prototype object and properties.

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create
	
**vehicle-object-dot-create-3.html**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8" />
	<title>Vehicle-3 Object.create() plus .prototype</title>
</head>
<body>
<script>
// Our "base" object
let vehicle = {
  year: 2018,
  numWheels: 4,
  move(){
    console.log("Moving the vehicle now");
  },
  toString(){
  	return "Year: " + this.year + ", numWheels: " + this.numWheels;
  }
};

// gasVehicle's prototype is vehicle
let gasVehicle = Object.create(vehicle);
	
// add specialized properties to our base object
gasVehicle.cylinders = 4;
gasVehicle.fuelCapacity = 12;

// call properties and methods on the `gasVehicle` object
console.log(gasVehicle.cylinders); 	// .cylinders is "own" property
gasVehicle.move(); 			// .move() is in the prototype (i.e. `vehicle`)
console.log(gasVehicle.valueOf()); 	// .valueOf() is in the prototype's prototype (the default prototype object)
console.log(gasVehicle.__proto__ == vehicle); // true!
debugger;
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Gives us this in the debugger:**

![Screenshot](_images/canvas-sprites-object-create-2.jpg)


**And this in the console:**

```javascript
4
Moving the vehicle now
{cylinders: 4, fuelCapacity: 12}
true
```

<hr>

#### III-B-i. Discussion
- Above we can see that we have created a form of inheritance, where `gasVehicle` "inherits" properties from `vehicle`, and `vehicle` inherits properties from the default prototype object.
- we can implement a form of overriding through property "shadowing" - properties added to `gasVehicle` will replace properties that are declared in its prototype objects. 
- but "inheritance" isn't really the right term for this extending of object behavior, "delegation" is a better term - read on!

<hr>

### III-B-ii. Delegation & OLOO - "Objects Linked to Other Objects"
In JavaScript, the prototype chain **links objects to other objects** 

The technique we have shown above uses *behavior delegation* to either extend or override state and behavior received from other objects. Objects *delegate* certain behavior to other objects, above, `gasVehicle` *delegated*  its `move()` method to `vehicle`.

### III-C. Creating `Vehicle` & `GasVehicle`  classes

- Below we will now use ES6 classes to model the same inheritance hierarchy

**vehicle-classes-4.html**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8" />
	<title>Vehicle-4 ES6 Classes & Inheritance</title>
</head>
<body>
<script>

class Vehicle{
	constructor(year,numWheels){
		this.year = year;
		this.numWheels = numWheels;
	}
	
	move(){
    console.log("Moving the vehicle now");
  }
  
  toString(){
  	return "Year: " + this.year + ", numWheels: " + this.numWheels;
  }
}

class GasVehicle extends Vehicle{
	constructor(year,numWheels,cylinders,fuelCapacity){
		super();
		// slick way to assign values to properties
		Object.assign(this, {year,numWheels,cylinders,fuelCapacity});
	}
}

let gasVehicle = new GasVehicle(2018,4,4,12);

console.log(gasVehicle.cylinders);
gasVehicle.move();
console.log(gasVehicle.valueOf());
console.log(gasVehicle.__proto__.__proto__.constructor == Vehicle); // true;

debugger;
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

### III-D. Comparing classes (`Vehicle` & `GasVehicle`) to delegation (`vehicle` and `gasVehicle`)

**In the debugger (the left side is OLOO, the right side is ES6 classes):**

![Screenshot](_images/object-create-1.png)


**In the console:**

```js
4
Moving the vehicle now
GasVehicle {year: 2018, numWheels: 4, cylinders: 4, fuelCapacity: 12}
true
```

#### III-D-i. Discussion - are these the same?
- In the screenshot above we can see that the left side (OLOO & delegation) and the right side (ES6 classes and inheritance) are nearly identical, except:
  - the properties from the class version are all on the top level object ...
  - we have additional `Constructor` functions in the class version ...
  - but behind the scenes, **the two object construction approaches both use the JavaScript prototype chain**

## IV. JavaScript engine fundamentals: Shapes and Inline Caches

- How does Chrome's V8 engine represent JavaScript objects?
- One optimization is to look for objects that have the same *shape* (i.e. list of properties) and store the duplicated data of the objects *separately*
- see:
  - https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/shapes-ics#object-model
  - https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/shapes-ics#optimizing-property-access
  
 ### IV-A. Questions
 
 1. From a performance standpoint, say you had 1000 JS sprite objects you wanted to put on the screen, do you think it would be better to use ES6 classes to create these, or to create them individually as Sprite literals?
