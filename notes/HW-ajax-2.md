# HW - Ajax-2 - loading and parsing CSV files

## Overview

- The video walkthrough for this assignment is here --> 
- We will build on what we did last time by modifying our plain-text loading code to instead download and parse a CSV ("**C**omma **S**eparated **V**alues") file

<hr>

## I. Start files
- Below is your plain-text data file **pet-names.csv** - it consists of the top-20 most popular pet dog names, followed by the 20-most popular pet cat names
- These names are *comma-separated*, and both dog and cat names appear in the one line of text in the file (not a very good structure, and we'll rectify that in **Ajax-2**)
- go ahead and create a **data** folder and place the **pet-names.txt** file into it:

<hr>

**data/pet-names.csv**

```text
Bella,Luna,Charlie,Lucy,Cooper,Max,Bailey,Daisy,Sadie,Lola,Buddy,Molly,Stella,Tucker,Bear,Zoey,Duke,Harley,Maggie,Jax
Oliver,Leo,Milo,Charlie,Simba,Max,Jack,Loki,Tiger,Jasper,Ollie,Oscar,George,Buddy,Toby,Smokey,Finn,Felix,Simon,Shadow
```
