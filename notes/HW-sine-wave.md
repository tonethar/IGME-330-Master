# Animated Sine Waves

## I. Overview
- As we know from Trigomometry, the *sine function* is the ratio of the length of the side that is opposite that angle to the length of the longest side of the triangle (the hypotenuse).
- A *sine wave* is a mathematical curve that describes a smooth periodic oscillation. 
- You might also know that in 1822, French mathematician Joseph Fourier discovered that sine waves can be used as building blocks to describe and approximate any periodic waveform.
- The sine wave pattern is often approximated in nature, including wind waves, sound waves, and light waves.
- We can use them to create a natural "ease" in a computer animation 
- Sine waves are cool! Let's go ahead and draw some now!

## III. Video Links

- [Sine Wave-1 (10:31)](https://video.rit.edu/Watch/sine-wave-1) - Drawing a static Sine wave:
  - NB: a better name for the `counter` variable in this video is `angle`
- [Sine Wave-2 (11:04)](https://video.rit.edu/Watch/sine-wave-2) - Drawing a animated Sine wave:
  - think about controls that could speed up or slow down the speed the waves are drawn, increase/decrease the *frequency* of the waves, and/or increase/decrease the *amplitude* of the waves.
  - NB: a better name for the `counter` variable in this video is `angle`
