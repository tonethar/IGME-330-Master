# HW - Ajax-1 - loading and parsing text files

## Overview

- In this series, we are going to walk through using the browser [XMLHttpRequest (aka "XHR")](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Using_XMLHttpRequest) and fetch(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) APIs to download data and display it to the user
- We will download and parse data in multiple formats - plain text, CSV, XML  and JSON
- Note: In 230/235 you have already had some experience with some of this - specifically XHR and JSON - go review those notes now if you wish:

## I. Start files

- Below is your plain-text data file **pet-names.txt** - it consists of the top-20 most popular pet dog names, followed by the 20-most popular pet cat names
- These names are *comma-separated*, and both dog and cat names appear in the one line of text in the file (not a very good structure, and we'll rectify that in **Ajax-2**
- go ahead and create a **data** fodler and place the **pet-names.txt** file into it:

<hr>

**data/pet-names.txt**

```text
Bella,Luna,Charlie,Lucy,Cooper,Max,Bailey,Daisy,Sadie,Lola,Buddy,Molly,Stella,Tucker,Bear,Zoey,Duke,Harley,Maggie,Jax,Oliver,Leo,Milo,Charlie,Simba,Max,Jack,Loki,Tiger,Jasper,Ollie,Oscar,George,Buddy,Toby,Smokey,Finn,Felix,Simon,Shadow
```

<hr>

- Here is our HTML file that has the HTML/CSS/JS to get us started"

**xhr-get-text.html**

```html

```
