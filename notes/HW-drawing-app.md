# HW - Drawing App Part I & II

## I. Overview
In this 2-part exercise we are going to build a canvas painting app that has the following capabilities:
- The drawing will happen on a "graph paper" background
- Pencil, Rectangle, and Line tools
- Controls for stroke color, fill color, and line width
- a button for clearing the canvas
- a button for exporting the contents on the PNG
- Additionally,the Rectangle and line tools will allow the user to preview their drawing before it is committed to the canvas, and the operation will be cancelled if the user drags the pointer out of the canvas window

This assignment is relevant for the Audio Visualizer project:
- it gives more practice with the canvas drawing API
- reviews how to hook up canvas drawing to a DOM interface
- it covers how to create a second temporary canvas and draw to it
- it reviews how to convert window mouse coordinates to "canvas coordinates"
  
## II. Submission
- the start files and instructions are here --> [Drawing-App-Start.zip](_files/Drawing-App-Start.zip)
- note that due to API changes, the *Export* button does not function on Chrome (and don't worry about that for now)
- see mycourses.rit.edu for due date
