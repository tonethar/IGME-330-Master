# I. Overview

- We are going to create a simple web service using node and npm
- We are going to deploy this server to Heroku using Git & Github

# II. Getting ready

1) You need a console app to type commands into:
  - On Mac OS you can use the built in *Terminal* app
  - On Windows you can use one of these:
    - [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701)
    - GitBash (this also installs git) - https://www.stanleyulili.com/git/how-to-install-git-bash-on-windows/
    - Powershell - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell
    
2) You must have node & npm installed - see the install instructions here --> https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

3) If you are going to deploy this to app to Heroku you will need:
