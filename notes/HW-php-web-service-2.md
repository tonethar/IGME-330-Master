## Overview
- Here you will learn about the basics of PHP by running though 3 short tutorials:
  - you may have already completed these tutorials in IGME-235 (if you took the course prior to 2195)
  - a list of our IGM PHP resources - which are mostly older IGME-235 assignments is here:

## I. Intro to PHP

- [Intro to PHP](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-Master/blob/master/notes/php-1.md)
- This page runs through the basics of PHP, how to create a simple PHP page, and how to view the details of banjo's PHP configuration

### I-A. Homework

- Read the [Intro to PHP](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-Master/blob/master/notes/php-1.md) page and try out the examples up on banjo
- Complete [Intro to PHP - section VII.](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-Master/blob/master/notes/php-1.md#section7) (the "Try This" part), then rename the file to **php-1-HW.php**, and post it to the web with your changes
- Also post the **info.php** file that you created to your web account. Be sure to verify that it shows you are running PHP 7.
- ZIP and POST both PHP files (**php-1-HW.php** & **info.php**) to the myCourses dropbox, and put the `people.rit.edu` links to each of them in the comments field.
- Read the 6 review questions - [Intro to PHP - section IX. Review Questions](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-Master/blob/master/notes/php-1.md#section9) - and type your answers into the comments field of the dropbox

## II. PHP Scalars & Data Types

- [PHP Scalars & Data Types](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-Master/blob/master/notes/php-2.md)
- This page runs though PHP variables, and the major data types and operators
- Getting though this page and doing the HW won't take too long

### II-A. Homework

- Read the [PHP Scalars & Data Types](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-Master/blob/master/notes/php-2.md) page and try out the examples up on banjo
- Complete [PHP Scalars & Data Types - Section X.](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-Master/blob/master/notes/php-2.md#section10) the three questions at the end of the page, and do the review exercise
- Post **php-2-HW.php** to banjo
- ZIP and POST the PHP file (**php-2-HW.php**) to the myCourses dropbox, and put the `people.rit.edu` link to it in the comments field
- Type your answers to the 3 review questions into the comments field of the dropbox

## III. PHP Arrays

- [PHP Arrays](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-Master/blob/master/notes/php-3.md)
- This page runs though how PHP *linear arrays* and *associative arrays* work (in PHP they are the same thing!) as well as the `$_SERVER` "super global"


### IIA-A. Homework

- Read the page and try out the examples up on banjo
- Complete the [PHP Arrays - Section VII.](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-Master/blob/master/notes/php-3.md#section7) review exercise
- Post **php-3A-HW.php** and **php-3B-HW.php** to banjo
- ZIP and POST both PHP files (**php-3A-HW.php** & **php-3B-HW.php**) to the myCourses dropbox, and put the `people.rit.edu` links to each of them in the comments field.

## IV. The php.ini file

- The **php.ini** file contains directives you can set to configure your PHP setup, and controls certain capabilities of how PHP runs for you on banjo.rit.edu
- Go do the assignment now --> [Homework - Configuring php.ini](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-php-ini.md)
- Post **broken.php** and **open.php** to the web
- Make sure that **broken.php** "works" and gives visible error messages! It's a lot harder to debug PHP code if the only error you are getting is a blank screen!
- Make sure that **open.php** works! You'll be using that capability in the "proxy server" HW soon!
- ZIP and POST these to mycourses, and put the links to both files in the dropbox comments field
